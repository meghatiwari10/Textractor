# Textractor

Tesseract Extractor is a software designed by Dignitas Digital leveraging the google tesseract/cube libraries. The technology extracts text from images, scans of printed text, and even handwriting, which means text can be extracted from pretty much any old books, manuscripts, or images. A simple & easy to use, and can detect most languages with over 90% accuracy. For certain custom categories we have been able to cross 98% accuracy.
